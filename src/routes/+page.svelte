					The massage techniques utilized for seniors include lighter, gentle stroking and kneading as well as

					the effects of aging.  A typical massage for a senior usually involves a short session lasting around 
					thirty minutes.

			<span>About</span>
		</h2>
		<p>
			<img class="image-mike" src={mike} alt="Portrait of Mike Vecchio" /> My interest in massage therapy 
			began nearly 20 years ago after two motor vehicle accidents.  
			With massage therapy, physiotherapy and other modalities, I was able to return to a healthy me.  
			Since then massage has always been important to me, both physically and mentally.  As an RMT I 
			look forward to working with my clients in a relaxing, calm and welcoming environment. Our lives 
			today can be overwhelming, and massage gives us that chance to unwind, focus on what our bodies 
			are telling us, and allow us to heal and relax.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a husband, father of 5, and grandfather, I know how busy and stressful life can be. Itâ€™s 
			important to look after ourselves, so we can feel our best to take on what life offers with 
			enthusiasm!                        
		</p>
		<p>
		I graduated with honours from Westervelt College Massage Therapy Program in 2019. I enjoy 
		working with clients of all ages to assist in promoting a healthier life, providing relaxation 
		and treating various issues. In my spare time I enjoy being outdoors, gardening and fishing, 
		and hikes with my wife!
		</p>
		<p>
			&#34;The practice of Massage Therapy is the assessment of the soft tissue and joints of the body 
			and the treatment and prevention of physical dysfunction and pain of the soft tissue and joints 
			by manipulation to develop, maintain, rehabilitate or augment physical function, or relieve pain.&#34; 
			(Massage Therapy Act, 1991)
		</p>
		<p>
			&#34;Massage therapy consists primarily of hands-on manipulation of the soft tissues of the body, 
			specifically, the muscles, connective tissue, tendons, ligaments and joints for the purpose of 
			optimizing health. Massage therapy treatment has a therapeutic effect on the body and optimizes 
			health and well-being by acting on the muscular, nervous and circulatory systems. Physical function 
			can be developed, maintained and improved; and physical dysfunction and pain and the effects of 
			stress can be relieved or prevented through the use of Massage Therapy. Various specialized 
			movements of the hands, over the skin or clothes, make up the Massage Therapy treatment. The 
			Massage Therapist will work with your level of pain tolerance during the treatment, and the 
			treatment can be stopped at any time should the treatment become 
			uncomfortable.&#34; <a href="http://www.cmto.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#40;www.cmto.com&#41;</a>
